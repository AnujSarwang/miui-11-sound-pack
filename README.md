# MIUI 11 SYSTEMLESS SOUNDS

Thx @ulgen0 for MIUI 11 system sounds.

**Attention!** Some sounds have to be set manually through settings such as your default alarm sound, default notifications sound, and Phone ringtone!

UI Sounds are replaced automatically.

Some alarm sounds/ringtones may appear repeated in the ringtone chooser, I think it depends on your rom.
